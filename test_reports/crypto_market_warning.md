## WARNING: Overbought Conditions

Multiple indicators suggest crypto markets are severely overbought and due for significant correction. Risk-averse traders should consider reducing exposure.

## Bearish Signals

### Technical Breakdown
- RSI(14) > 80 on weekly chart (extreme overbought)
- Bearish divergence forming on MACD
- Volume declining while price rises (weak rally)
- Death cross forming on 4-hour chart

### Macro Concerns
- Federal Reserve hawkish stance continuing
- Interest rates likely to rise further
- Stock market correlation at all-time high
- Recession fears mounting

### Market Structure Weaknesses
- Tether dominance raising stability concerns
- Exchange reserves at multi-year lows (liquidity crisis risk)
- Whale wallets showing distribution patterns
- Retail FOMO at dangerous levels

## Historical Parallels

Current setup mirrors:
- December 2017 peak (before -85% crash)
- April 2021 top (before -50% correction)
- November 2021 ATH (before -75% bear market)

**Pattern:** Extreme euphoria → Sharp correction

## Recommended Action

**Conservative Strategy:**
- Reduce crypto exposure to 5% or less
- Take profits on winning positions
- Increase stablecoin allocation
- Set tight stop-losses (8-10%)

**Entry:** Wait for 30-40% correction
**Target:** NA (preservation mode)
**Stop-Loss:** Already in place

## Contradicting View

While sentiment is bullish, fundamentals don't support current valuations. Bitcoin at $45K implies $900B market cap with limited real-world adoption beyond speculation.

Ethereum's "ultrasound money" narrative questionable with actual usage fees still high.

## Risk Assessment

**Confidence Level:** 7/10 (for correction)
**Risk Level:** VERY HIGH
**Market Regime:** VOLATILE / UNCERTAIN

**Disclaimer:** This is a contrarian view. Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. Use proper risk management regardless of outlook.
