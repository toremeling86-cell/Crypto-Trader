# Crypto Trader

This repository currently only contains documentation; no source files or configuration are present. If you expected additional code, make sure the upstream repository or archive has been synchronized into this working copy.

## Checking for missing content
1. Confirm that you have access to the upstream source (for example a Git remote or a release archive).
2. Add the remote if needed and fetch the latest history:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin <remote-url>
   git fetch origin
   git checkout <branch>
   ```
3. If you have been provided a zip/tar archive instead of a remote, extract it into the repository directory and commit the files.

## Next steps
- Populate the repository with the expected application files.
- Commit the imported code so that this repository reflects the current state of the project.

If you are not sure which version should be present, ask the project owner for the latest source bundle.
